 * There must be a Player class that must hold (among other things):
 * a list of Country objects that are owned by the Player 
 * a list of Order objects that have been created by the Player during the current turn, and 
 *     has a method "issue_order()" (no parameters, no return value) whose function is to add 
 *     an order to the list of orders held by the player when the game engine calls it during 
 *     the issue orders phase. The player class must also have a "next_order()" (no parameters) 
 *     method that is called by the GameEngine during the execute orders phase and returns the 
 *     first order in the playerâ€™s list of orders, then removes it from the list.
